## The display Property

The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.


### Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

```
The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
```

### Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
```
Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>
```
### Display: none;

display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them.

```
span {
  display: block;
}
```
